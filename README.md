# wireguard-generator

Server sided wireguard config generator
Untested, kind of stable, definetely not recommended for production but decent as a starting point for your use case
WIP but not really, this was used for an internal VPN and it did work so I'm publishing.

**Quick pro tip**: wg binary has to have net_admin capability to avoid running as root
